# To-Do-List-application

This is a simple command-line To-Do List application written in Python.
It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks, with all tasks stored in a todo.txt file.

#Features

--Add Task:

Users can add new tasks, which are automatically assigned a serial number.

--View Tasks:

Displays all current tasks in a formatted list. If no tasks exist, a message is shown.

--Remove Task:

Users can remove a task by entering its serial number. The list is automatically renumbered after removal.


#How It Works:

The program displays a menu with options to view, add, or remove tasks, or exit.
Tasks are stored with serial numbers for easy management.
The first line of todo.txt is used as a header and is not affected by task operations.
